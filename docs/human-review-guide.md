# Epic Creator and Decomposer: Human Review Guide

*For engineers, SMEs, and architects looking at the epics this pipeline creates.*

**In short:** twice a day, this pipeline reads the RHAISTRAT strategies that have
passed the strategy rubric, been signed off by a human, and are targeted at 3.6,
and turns each one into
a reviewed **proposal** — a dependency graph (DAG) of implementation epics created
in the **RHAI** Jira project. Every breakdown clears an adversarial quality review
*before* a single epic is created, so what lands in Jira is something we stand
behind. Every epic it creates carries the label `epic-creator-auto-created`.

Start with the epic DAG for your strategy. If something doesn't fit your plan,
adjust it — and please tell us in **#wg-rhai-epic-and-code-gen** so we can keep
making it better.

| Repo | What it is |
|---|---|
| [`epic-creator`](https://github.com/opendatahub-io/epic-creator) | The brain — the skill and prompts that do the decomposition. |
| [`epic-decomposer`](https://gitlab.com/redhat/rhel-ai/agentic-ci/epic-decomposer) | The runner — the CI job that runs it against Jira twice a day. |
| [`epic-decomposer-results`](https://gitlab.com/redhat/rhel-ai/agentic-ci/epic-decomposer-results) | The results store — every run's epics, reviews, and a dashboard, versioned by timestamp. |

## How it works

Twice a day the pipeline:

1. **Reads** the signed-off strategies that qualify (see below).
2. **Decomposes** each into a DAG of epics — Implementation and Investigation
   epics, with dependency links between them.
3. **Reviews** the breakdown adversarially and scores it out of 14. If it doesn't
   pass, it's revised and re-reviewed. **Nothing is created in Jira until the
   review passes.**
4. **Creates** the epics in **RHAI**, wired together with "Blocks" dependency links.
5. **Publishes** a visual DAG and an HTML dashboard to `epic-decomposer-results`.

As a reader you mostly care about three things: the **epic list** for your
strategy, each epic's **acceptance criteria**, and the **rendered DAG** that shows
how the epics depend on one another. The easiest place to see all three is the
**[dashboard](https://epic-decomposer-dashboard-4e1d18.gitlab.io/)** — open the
**Strategy Tracker** tab and find your RHAISTRAT. The same content also lives in
`epic-tasks/RHAISTRAT-<id>-decomposition.md` in the results repo.

> **Coming soon:** we'll be integrating this with **Org Pulse**, so you'll be able
> to see the decomposed epics alongside the rest of your team's work there too.

> **Note:** this only generates *epics* right now — we are **not** generating code
> automatically yet. This is still a work in progress and we're experimenting with
> a small number of epics. If you have an epic that's boring or small and you'd
> like us to give it a try, let us know in **#wg-rhai-epic-and-code-gen**.

## Which strategies we generate epics for

A strategy enters the pipeline when it is a **RHAISTRAT Feature** that is:

> labeled **`strat-creator-rubric-pass`** **and** **`strat-creator-human-sign-off`**,
> with a **Target Version of 3.6** (any of the 3.6 EA/GA values).

In plain terms: it passed the strategy rubric, a human signed off on it, and it's
targeted at 3.6. That target-version filter is the one thing we bump each release —
right now it's 3.6 only.

## When we don't create epics

We deliberately stay out of the way in these cases:

- **It already has epics.** If the strategy already has child Epics (or a legacy
  "Incorporates" link), we skip it and never re-decompose — your existing
  breakdown wins.
- **The quality review didn't pass.** A breakdown has to score **≥ 10 out of 14
  with no criterion scoring zero**. If it doesn't clear that bar, nothing is
  submitted to Jira. 
- **It's below the threshold.** Small strategies (S-sized, one component, one
  team, mostly high-confidence work) collapse to a single epic instead of a DAG.
- **It's documentation only.** If every affected component is "no code changes" or
  "reference only," you get one docs-authoring epic.
- **A component is passive.** A component that only needs to keep working (no code
  changes) becomes an acceptance criterion on the nearest active epic rather than
  its own epic — unless a *different* team has to validate it, in which case it
  gets its own validation epic.

## Investigation epics

Epics come in two types:

- **Implementation** — produces an artifact (code, config, docs, manifests, an
  upstream PR, and so on).
- **Investigation** — resolves an uncertainty that a downstream decision depends
  on.

The line between "this deserves its own Investigation epic" and "this is just an
acceptance criterion" comes down to one question:

> **Does the answer change which downstream epics exist or what they do?**
> **Yes** → it's an Investigation epic, and the epics that depend on its outcome
> are gated on it. **No** → it's an acceptance criterion on an Implementation epic.

Because an investigation is inherently more open-ended than implementation work,
it's routed by its own scoring: **High** → handled by the AI investigation skill,
**Medium** → a hybrid where the skill does the desk/local work and hands a spec to
a human, **Low** → assigned to a person.

> **Heads up:** investigation epics aren't 100% automated yet. If you land on one
> and aren't sure how to take it forward, **ping us in #wg-rhai-epic-and-code-gen**
> and we'll help.

## Labels

Every epic and strategy the pipeline touches is labeled so you can find and filter
them.

**On each auto-created epic (in RHAI):**

| Label | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `epic-creator-auto-created` | Always applied — marks every epic this pipeline created. |
| `epic-creator-investigation` | The epic is an Investigation (vs. Implementation). |
| `epic-creator-impl-<type>` | Implementation subtype, e.g. `epic-creator-impl-docs-authoring`. |
| `epic-creator-ai-impl-*` | The epic's AI-implementability class — `high`, `medium`, or `low`. |
| `epic-creator-needs-component` | The component isn't in the canonical RHAI component list yet. |

**On the source strategy (in RHAISTRAT):**

| Label | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `epic-creator-auto-decomposed` | Applied only when **all** of the strategy's epics were successfully created. |

The two labels that decide whether a strategy *enters* the pipeline —
`strat-creator-rubric-pass` and `strat-creator-human-sign-off` — come from the
upstream strat-creator pipeline, not this one. And `epic-creator-ai-impl-*` simply
reflects the AI-implementability class described in the Advanced section below.

## If an epic isn't right — what to do

The breakdown is a reviewed proposal, but you own your delivery. Here's the flow:

1. **Start from the visual DAG** for your strategy — open the
   **[dashboard](https://epic-decomposer-dashboard-4e1d18.gitlab.io/)** and its
   **Strategy Tracker** tab. It shows every epic, its type, and how they depend on
   each other at a glance.
   That's the fastest way to sanity-check the whole shape before looking at any
   single epic.
2. **If an epic is wrong or unnecessary, just close it.** No ceremony required.
3. **Create your own epics in RHOAIENG** to complement (or replace) these if you
   need to. **RHAI is the AI-generated project**; **RHOAIENG** is the normal
   engineering backlog where humans track real delivery work.
4. **Tell us in #wg-rhai-epic-and-code-gen.** Two things help us the most:
   - whether the epic breakdown and its DAG were correct, and
   - if you created your own epics, *what* you created and *why* the generated
     ones didn't fit.

   That feedback is exactly how the pipeline keeps getting better.

> **Please keep in mind:** a slight rename of an epic title is totally fine. But if you
> want to change an epic's content or its acceptance criteria, please talk to us in
> **#wg-rhai-epic-and-code-gen** first — those are what we learn from, and quietly
> editing them makes it hard for us to tell whether the breakdown was right.
